# Fabric Layers

## this project is an NX monorepo with two packages:

- fabric-layers-core

fabric-layers-core is a fabric.js coordinate-plane (grid) & layers library

the fabric-layers-core/grid-demo.html file is a demo of the library, do not use native fabric.js routines where a class from this repo is available

- fabric-layers-react   

fabric-layers-react is a React wrapper around the fabric-layers fabric-layers package

the fabric-layers-react/plane-demo.html file is a simple demo of how to use the fabric-layers library -- do not use native fabric.js methods in this file, only use fabric-layer-react components
