# react development workflow components
React Development Workflow:
- Location: packages/fabric-layers-react/example
- Purpose: Building and testing React components for fabric-layers
- Key Points:
  1. ONLY use components from packages/fabric-layers-react/src/components
  2. Using fabric-layers-core as dependency
  3. This is an iterative development process to refine components
  4. End goal: Publish as fabric-layers-react package
- Development Rules:
  1. No direct fabric.js usage - everything through components
  2. All new features should be added as components
  3. Example folder serves as testing ground
  4. Components must be thoroughly tested before publishing
