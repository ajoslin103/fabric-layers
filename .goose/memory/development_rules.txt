# rules yarn nvm fabric.js
Critical Development Rules:
1. Always use Yarn v1 for package management
2. Use NVM for Node.js version management (v22.16.0)
3. Do not use native fabric.js routines where a fabric-layers class is available
4. In React components, only use fabric-layer-react components, not native fabric.js methods
