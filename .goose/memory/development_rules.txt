# rules yarn nvm fabric.js
Critical Development Rules:
1. Always use Yarn v1 for package management
2. Use NVM for Node.js version management (v22.16.0)
3. Do not use native fabric.js routines where a fabric-layers class is available
4. In React components, only use fabric-layer-react components, not native fabric.js methods

# react components rules development
React Component Development Rules:
1. Component Source: ONLY use/import from packages/fabric-layers-react/src/components
2. NO direct fabric.js usage - everything must go through components
3. Development Flow:
   - Build components in src/components
   - Test in example folder
   - Iterate until stable
   - Only then consider publishing
4. Dependencies:
   - fabric-layers-core (our core library)
   - React components must wrap all core functionality
