# development vue approach context
Development Approach:
- While the final goal involves React components (fabric-layers-react), development proceeds in smaller, focused steps
- Current focus: Creating a Vue.js implementation that consumes fabric-layers-core
- This Vue implementation is separate from and does not use any React code
- The grid-demo.html from fabric-layers-core serves as reference for core library functionality
- Multiple parallel implementations/approaches are valid within the monorepo
- Each implementation should be treated as its own project with its own requirements
